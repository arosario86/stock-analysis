# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
My friend Steve has asked me to help him analyze a number of stocks. 
His parents are focused on investing in one particular stock, but it turns out it would not be a great investment choice for him.
He has now asked me to run analysis on all of the listed stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 so that he can help them choose the right stock for investment.

### Purpose
My friend Steve has asked me to help him analyze a number of stocks. 
His parents are focused on investing in one particular stock, but it turns out it would not be a great investment choice for him.
He has now asked me to run analysis on all of the listed stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 so that he can help them choose the right stock for investment.

## Analysis and Challenges
Overall analysis on the data shows that the successful kickstarter campaigns all had goal amounts that were either the same, or a little less than was pledged.
Those who had very high goals, failed due to low amounts pledged towards their campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I created a pivot chart analysing the outcomes based on their launch dates and factored in those that were successful, failed, or canceled.
The month of May had the highest rate of successful launches.
The month of May had the highest failed launches. 
The month of December had the lowest rate of successful launches, while the month of November had the lowest rate of failed launches.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaign goals of $1000 to $4999 had the most successful campaigns.
Campaign goals of $1000 to $4999 had the most failed campaigns.
Campaign goals of $50000 or more had the most canceled campaigns.
I ran an analysis to figure out the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled.The campaigns with goals less than $1000 had the highest percentage rate of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I had a number of issues when computing my formulas via the excel sheet. At first, the list of canceled campaigns did not sure. I cleared my filters and was able to view all campaigns.
Another challenge I faced was the COUNTIF formula. After figuring out the correct way to perform the formula, I then encountered a little bit of difficulty when trying to figure out the formula for each goal set.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion I came to was that the months May and June seem to be the best months to produce a successful campaign.
My second conclusion based on the data is, the month of December seems to have an even amount of both successful and failed campaigns.
Total number of successful campaigns total is 37, and the number of failed campaigns total is 35.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based of the results, the higher the campaign goal, the higher the percentage of a failed campaign. A successful outcome depends on the goal amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation is that it is focused on theaters/plays. It only gives a small picture of the data and not a general view on kickstarter campaigns.
This dataset also does not take into account age groups. It would be helpful to see what age groups are viewing each play and pinpoint success and failure based on each group.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A bar whisker chart would be helpful as it would enable Louise to view the outliers in the data. This can help her and others kickstarting campaigns to set their goals to the appropriate amount when starting up.
