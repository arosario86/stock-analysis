# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
My friend Steve has asked me to help him analyze a number of stocks. 
His parents are focused on investing in one particular stock, but it turns out it would not be a great investment choice for them.
Steve initially had me run an analysis on DQ, which proved to his parents why they should not invest in that stock.
He has now asked me to run analysis on all of the stocks listed in his data set for the years 2017 and 2018 so that he can help them choose the right stock for investment.
The purpose of this anaylsis was to help Steve view each stock, it's total volume, and compare for the years 2017 and 2018. 
My final task was then to refactor my code so that the reporting can be resulted quicker, and the code listed can be cleaner and easier to read.

## Results
The intial report ran a little longer than the refactored report.
The first report and its initial code ran longer due to its longer macro code, whereas the refactored code came back quicker.
The 2017 report came back with 0.148 seconds result and the 2018 report came back with 0.371 seconds.
Based on the results of each reported year, TERP had a negative return of -7.2%, and in 2018 had a negative return of -5.0%.
Steve's parent's should look into investing with RUN which had a return of 84% in 2018, and 5.5% in 2017.

## Summary
The advantages of refactoring code is that you have a basis to start with.
What I mean by that is, there is already a basic outline of code listed and your job is to just simplify it.
The downside of refactoring code is having to go back and edit each and every line of code.
If one code is missed, or two sections of code are not updated, it can generate an error message and keep you guessing for hours (as it did to me).
The disadvantages of refactoring VBA code is having to go back line for line to edit, or condense a ton of existing code.
For me, this created confusion and many errors popping up while trying to run the code.
After a lot of trial and error(stackflow and youtube resources), I was able to figure out how to refactor my code and get it to work.
The overall advantage of refactoring VBA code is the cleanliness of the overall code.
Not only is the VBA code simplier and easier to read, it results quicker overall.
As I mentioned earlier, my original reporting results came back slower and resulted in me having to wait a second or two for the results.
The new VBA code came back less than a second later.
